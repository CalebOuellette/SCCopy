# SCCopy README

SCCopy is a copy paste manager. SCCopy uses the the same hotkey structure that StarCraft 2 uses for control groups.

## Features

Use Ctrl + any number to copy an item.

Use Alt + any number to paste that item.
>In the future I want to change this to double tabbing the number, or press the number then tab like a code snippet. 

> animations coming soon!!

## Requirements

Visual Studio?

## Extension Settings

## Known Issues

In Visual Studio code Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, Ctrl+3 are used to split the editor windows. This extension overwrites those hotkeys... sorry.
