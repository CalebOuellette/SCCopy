# SCCopy README
A Visual Studio Code Extention.

SCCopy is a copy paste manager. SCCopy uses the the same hotkey structure that StarCraft 2 uses for control groups.

## Features

Use Ctrl + (any number) to copy an item.

Use Alt + (any number) to paste that item.

>In the future I want to change this to double tabbing the number, or press the number then tab like a code snippet. VScode extension don't directly support this kinda stuff, so not sure how I'm going to do this. Hit me up if you have an idea.  

> animations coming soon!!

## Requirements

Visual Studio Code!

## Extension Settings

>Will add some settings... maybe.

## Known Issues

In Visual Studio code Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, Ctrl+3 are used to split the editor windows. This extension overwrites those hotkeys... sorry. 

So this copy paste stuff only works inside VScode... This realy caught me off guard... In hindsight this is really obvious. Possible going to turn this into a system app if I like using this pattern of copy/paste.
